This is my first ever project I put my heart on. It is a game searcher web app that I use to explore my capabilities in Javascript. It uses vanilla JS and RAWG API for the datas. 
Will add more features soon after I finish exploring my new interest, which is reactJS websites with integration of AI technologies. 
Hope you appreciate it !
